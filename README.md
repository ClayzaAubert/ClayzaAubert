### 👋 Hi! I'm a programming enthusiast who loves building creative and functional applications.
I mostly work with JavaScript, especially using Node.js, and I frequently use MongoDB as my primary database due to its flexibility and powerful document-oriented structure.

🛠️ I enjoy working on:
- REST API development, integrating useful and dynamic features.
- Web scraping, to collect relevant data that enhances app functionality.
- Bot development, automating repetitive tasks and applying smart logic.
- Exploring AI-related technologies, including machine learning and NLP, to create more intelligent and adaptive systems.

💡 I believe that every project I build is not just about writing code—it's about creating something meaningful, efficient, and impactful.
